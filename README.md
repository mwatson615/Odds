# Odds-v2
Version 2 of the Odds app in development - v1 deployed at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rosebay.odds

Odds is a platform for users to decide the probability of anything.  Do you think the US will ever win the World Cup?  
Odds lets you put that out into the world (someone already did, and it's not looking good for the US).

Votes for and against are calculated to determine a probability percentage which is updated in real time, and the app 
keeps track of favorites and users' posts.

Odds uses Google Custom Search to find public domain images and Google Cloud Platform for backend.  Android development 
is a mix of Java and Kotlin and follows the MVP pattern.
